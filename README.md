### _Homework and Timetable management for iOS_

## About hDub
> hDub is an iOS/Android app for managing your homework and timetable. <br>
> It syncronises with [KAMAR](http://www.kamar.co.nz), New Zealand's main Student Management/Timetabling system, to provide a seamless experience for new users

hDub was released in early 2013 at Wellington Girls' College, but due to the nature of the app (being written with web technologies and running in Phonegap), it was slow and unresponsive, and therefore did not gain many users.

## About hDubNative
hDubNative is a project to port hDub to a native iOS app, making it much more fast and user-friendly, as well as improving the design.

## Installation
The original hDub is available on the iOS App Store here:

## Project Status
hDubNative is currently being actively developed by [printfn](https://github.com/printfn), and scheduled for release within the next month.

We would be glad to accept any feature requests, bug reports, or pull requests.

## Android App
